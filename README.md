# Interactive-B-zier-Curve-with-Physics-Sensor-Control
In this project, the interactive cubic Bézier curve is implemented in HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript, which acts as a springy rope. All the Bézier curve mathematics, calculating the tangent of a curve with the analytic derivative, and a mechanics model of a spring-damping are all manually implemented without using any external library or pre-built API. The curve is receptive to real-time mouse movement, displays control points and tangents, and uses requestAnimationFrame to keep the animation in constant process. The project shows a good knowledge system of mathematical modeling, graphics programming, and real time interaction in a web-based system.
